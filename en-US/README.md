1. **Cooperation and Coordination**: If you are working on a collaborative project, it is best to coordinate your work with other project members to avoid conflicts. Make sure everyone knows when to push and pull to avoid overwriting each other's changes.

Whichever method you choose, handle it with care to ensure you don't lose any important changes or destroy the integrity of your project. If you're not sure what to do, contact other contributors or maintainers of the project for help and guidance.
