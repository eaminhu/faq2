<p>&amp;#x20;Decentralized finance ("DeFi" for short) is built on the <a href="https://academy.binance.com/zh/articles/how-does-blockchain-work"> area An ecosystem of financial applications on top of the blockchain</a>network. Specifically, the term “decentralized finance” refers to the creation of an ecosystem of financial services that is open source, permissionless, and transparent. This ecosystem is open to everyone and operates without authorization from any central authority. Users have full control over their assets and can use <a href="https://academy.binance.com/zh/articles/peer-to-peer-networks-explained">Peer-to-Peer (P2P)</a>, <a href="https://academy.binance.com/glossary/decentralized-application">Decentralized applications (Dapps)</a> interact with the ecosystem. The core advantage of DeFi is that financial services are within reach, especially for people who are isolated from the current financial system. Another potential advantage of DeFi is that it is built on a modular framework - extremely interoperable among public blockchains. a>DeFi applications can create entirely new financial markets, products and services. </p>
