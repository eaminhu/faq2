<p>The Open Lending Protocol is one of the most popular applications in the DeFi ecosystem. Compared with the traditional credit system, open decentralized lending has many advantages, including instant transaction settlement, support for collateralized digital assets, no credit review, and the possibility of standardization in the future. </p>
