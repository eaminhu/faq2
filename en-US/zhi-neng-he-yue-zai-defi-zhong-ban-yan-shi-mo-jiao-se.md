<h3>What role do smart contracts play in DeFi? &lt;a href=&quot;#header-6&quot; id=&quot;header-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
<p>Most existing and potential decentralized finance applications involve <a href="https://academy.binance.com/zh/articles/what-are-smart-contracts">smart contracts</ a>Creation and execution. While regular contracts spell out the relationships between the different entities in the contract through legal terms, smart contracts use computer code. </p>
<p>The terms in a smart contract are written in computer code, and running the code makes them effective. Many business processes that originally required manual supervision can now be executed automatically, ensuring reliability. </p>
<p>Using smart contracts, both parties can reach transactions more conveniently and quickly, and transaction risks are also reduced. On the other hand, smart contracts also bring new risks. Computer code is prone to errors or vulnerabilities that could reveal very important confidential information. </p>

<h3>What challenges does DeFi face? &lt;a href=&quot;#header-7&quot; id=&quot;header-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inefficiency: Blockchains are naturally slow compared to their centralized competitors, which also affects the applications built on them. Developers of DeFi applications need to take these limitations into account and continuously optimize their products. </li>
<li>High risks caused by user errors: DeFi applications shift responsibility from intermediaries to users, causing trouble for many people. Products are deployed on a blockchain that cannot be tampered with, so it is very difficult to minimize losses caused by user errors through product design. </li>
<li>User inexperience: Currently, users have to work extra hard to navigate DeFi applications. In order to become a core element of the global financial system, DeFi applications must bring tangible value to users, causing them to bid farewell to the traditional financial system and move to DeFi applications. </li>
<li>Ecosystem Chaos: Finding the most suitable application for a specific use case is extremely difficult, and users must have the ability to find the best solution. The challenge comes not only from building applications, but also from how to integrate users into the huge DeFi ecosystem. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the difference between DeFi and Open Banking? &lt;a href=&quot;#header-8&quot; id=&quot;header-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
<p>Open banking means that the banking system authorizes third-party financial service providers through <a href="https://academy.binance.com/glossary/application-programming-interface">API</a> to allow them to Secure access to financial data. In this way, banks and non-bank financial institutions can link accounts and data. Essentially, it can create new products and services within the traditional financial system. </p>
<p>However, the new financial system proposed by DeFi is completely independent of the existing infrastructure. Therefore, DeFi is sometimes called ‚Äúopen finance‚Äù. </p>
<p>For example, it can securely obtain data from many banks and institutions and manage all traditional financial instruments in the same application. </p>
<p>On the other hand, decentralized finance supports a new financial instrument management model and creates a new way of interaction. </p>
